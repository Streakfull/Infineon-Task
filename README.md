## Goal

Develop a simple web application that ranks companies in order of relevance to a given search term. The
application should consist of a backend with endpoints to insert new companies to the database and search for
companies based on a search term and return them ordered by relevance. You should create a database to
store company information such as name and description. A frontend will be required to allow users to submit
search terms and display a list of companies ordered by relevance. Additionally, it would be of benefit if a user
can add new companies to the system.
